CONTACT MANAGEMENT: 
I have designed this project to help users organize hundreds of contacts.it includes the ability to store key details such as names, address, email, telephone number and past activities. Keeping the contacts organized is the most important function of a contact  manager that is why we will need contact lists.

This project will the user will be able to enter his/her:
id,name
phone
email
address
loginName
password
role
loginstatus.


This will include the following features
Add contacts
List contacts
Update contacts
Delete contacts

To develop my project for it to run I will need the following tools 
EclipseIDE2019
SpringContactApp
